# Setting Up Large Language Models on Google Colab

This repository provides detailed tutorials for setting up and running Large Language Models (LLMs) on Google Colab. Whether you have access to GPU acceleration or are limited to a CPU-only environment, these guides will help you get started with deploying and utilizing LLMs efficiently.

## Features

- **GPU Accelerated Setup**: Leverage the power of Google Colab's GPUs to significantly speed up your model's performance.
- **CPU Only Setup**: A detailed guide to setting up LLMs on a CPU-only environment, perfect for users without access to GPU resources.
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Each tutorial includes step-by-step instructions, from setting up the environment to executing the model.
- **Code Examples**: Includes complete, runnable Jupyter notebooks that you can directly import into Colab and start using.
